                            Following an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, Microsoft has said it will make changes to its Game Pass program that will
                            make it easier for subscribers to cancel the service, and will stop taking payments for subscriptions that go dormant.
                            <br><br>
                            The CMA said that it first "identified concerns about certain features of Microsoftâ€™s auto-renewing subscriptions" as part of a wider investigation into
                            online gaming. Those concerns included clarity about automatic subscription renewal, ease of disabling automatic renewals, and whether customers may be
                            unwittingly paying for old subscriptions that they were no longer using.

                                    The CMA said that it first "identified concerns about certain features of Microsoftâ€™s auto-renewing subscriptions" as part of a wider
                                    investigation into online gaming. Those concerns included clarity about automatic subscription renewal, ease of disabling automatic renewals,
                                    and whether customers may be unwittingly paying for old subscriptions that they were no longer using.
                                    <br><br>
                                    As a result, Microsoft has now committed to making changes to its Game Pass and Xbox Live services, including:
                                    <br><br>
                                    Better upfront information: Microsoft will provide more transparent, upfront information to help customers understand their Xbox
                                    membershipâ€”making clear, for example, that the subscription will auto-renew unless the customer turns off auto-renewal; when the subscription
                                    will auto-renew; how much it will cost; and how the customer can receive a refund after an accidental renewal.
                                    Refunds: Microsoft will contact existing customers on recurring 12-month contracts and give them the option to end their contract and claim a
                                    pro-rata refund.
                                    Inactive memberships: Microsoft will also contact existing customers who havenâ€™t used their memberships for a long time but are still paying.
                                    These customers will be reminded how to stop payments, and if they continue not to use their memberships, Microsoft will ultimately stop taking
                                    further payments.
                                    Better information about price increases: Microsoft will give clearer notifications of any future price rises, and will ensure people know how
                                    to turn off auto-renewal if they donâ€™t want to pay the higher price.
                                    "Gamers need to be given clear and timely information to make informed choices when signing up for auto-renewing memberships and subscriptions,"
                                    CMA executive director of enforcement Michael Grenfell said. "We are therefore pleased that Microsoft has given the CMA these formal
                                    undertakings to improve the fairness of their practices and protect consumers, and will be offering refunds to certain customers."
                                    <br><br>
                                    Grenfell also warned that other companies offering subscriptions based services "should take note and review their practices to ensure they
                                    comply with consumer protection law."
                                    <br><br>
                                    It's a situation a lot of us have likely been in at least once in our lives: Paying for services we're not using for months on end, because
                                    we've forgotten about them or it's just too much of a pain in the ass to cancel on the rare occasions that they come to mind. Either way, it's
                                    money wasted, and while the CMA announcement is short on specificsâ€”there's no indication as to exactly how long "a long time" is, for
                                    instanceâ€”it's a move in the right direction.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The CMA is a UK-based agency, but a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed in an email to PC Gamer that the subscription policy changes will be
                                    applied internationally. "Changes to inactive subscriptions will initially roll out in the UK and will be available globally soon," the
                                    representative said.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently said that he doesn't view subscriptions as a replacement for conventional purchases, but there's no
                                    question that Game Pass is big business for Microsoft. The service recently surpassed 25 million subscribers and that number is bound to

                                    Blizzard's effort to hire new developers for the project is surely being helped by all the praise, especially in the context of last year's
                                    sexism and harassment allegations and uncertainties around the impending Microsoft acquisition, but the enthusiasm appears to be genuine. Asked
                                    whether Blizzard had any part in the outpouring of praise, a company spokesperson told PC Gamer that the company "did not encourage employees to
                                    make positive posts about the recent announcement."
                                    <br><br>
                                    "We have a talented team creating this game, and we're happy to see their genuine enthusiasm for their work, and others' excitement to share
                                    it," the spokesperson said.

                                    Notably, even some of Activision Blizzard's most outspoken critics have praised the project.
                                    <br><br>
                                    "Super excited about today's reveal," wrote Valentine Powell, a World of Warcraft senior UI engineer who has helped organize Activision Blizzard
                                    employees in the wake of last year's sexism and harassment lawsuit. "This game looks amazing, and I'm happy that the devs on the project can now
                                    be open about working on it."
                                    <br><br>
                                    Leading the survival game project is Craig Amai, who previously worked on World of Warcraft for over a decade, starting as an in-game customer
                                    support lead in 2004 and concluding as lead quest designer. According to his LinkedIn resume, Amai began work on the survival game four and a
                                    half years ago, in July 2017.

                                    "Once upon a time this dream project was [a] humble pitch deck on my desktop," Amai wrote on Twitter. "Now itâ€™s a team full of caring and
                                    passionate people sharing a vision I couldnâ€™t be prouder to be part of."

                            After I played hours of Elden Ring in last year's network test, I wrote that it was the most flexible Souls game by a longshot. Flexible doesn't
                            necessarily mean easyâ€”there are still bosses in Elden Ring who will stomp you mercilessly until you learn their patternsâ€”but you can now explore the
                            open world looking for easier battles or more gear. FromSoftware boss Hidetaka Miyazaki cited that flexibility in a new interview on the PlayStation
                            Blog, in which he touched on the notorious difficulty of the studio's games. "Iâ€™d like new players to feel unpressured and that they can approach the
                            game at their pace," Miyazaki said.
                            <br><br>
                            "I realize that while we offer games with a high level of challenge, we design them in a way that feels fulfilling to overcome. But I donâ€™t want new
                            players to worry or stress about that difficulty too muchâ€¦ They can come back to something later when theyâ€™re at an impasse so that they can have this
                            freedom of progression and not have to bang their head against a wall over and over."

                                    Arguments over game difficultyâ€”and whether developers should include customizable difficulty optionsâ€”flare up around the release of each new
                                    FromSoftware game, and Elden Ring will likely be no different. And yes, Miyazaki is well aware of the debate.
                                    <br><br>
                                    "Itâ€™s a valid discussion," he said. "I feel like our approach to these games, not just Elden Ring, is to design them to encourage the player to
                                    overcome adversity. We donâ€™t try to force difficulty or make things hard for the sake of it. We want players to use their cunning, study the
                                    game, memorize whatâ€™s happening, and learn from their mistakes. We donâ€™t want players to feel like the game is unfairly punishing, but rather
                                    that thereâ€™s a chance to win a difficult encounter and make progress. We understand that Souls-like games are regularly associated with
                                    impossible levels of difficulty with high barriers to entry. But we try to design the games to make the cycle of repeatedly trying to overcome
                                    these challenges enjoyable in itself. So we hope that with Elden Ring and the new options it provides, it will be a success in that respect."
                                    <br><br>
                                    Miyazaki said that the Elden Ring team has not "intentionally tried to lower the gameâ€™s difficulty," but that he thinks that the freedom of the
                                    open world and the ease of playing in multiplayer compared to previous Souls games will mean more players make it to the end of this one.
                                    <br><br>
                                    And if you do make it to the end, Miyazaki confirmed that a New Game+ option will be there waiting for you. Elden Ring is out on February 25th.

                                    As well as Mortal Kombat, Russo has written the upcoming Space Invaders and Saints Row movies. He also wrote a Resident Evil script that never
                                    got off the ground, which he shared some details of following this announcement. "What I can tell you is it followed RE7 into RE8. Basically
                                    Ethan, Mia, Zoe, Eveline, etc. But there was uncertainty at the time as to how RE7 was going to perform. This was early 2017. In hindsight, it
                                    performed really well. Idk. Would have been fun."
